Vagrant Configuration Files
=======================

Vagrantfile\_1
------------

This file is compatible with Vagrant < 1.1.  If you have Vagrant 1.1+ installed on your machine, use the contents of configuration file Vagrantfile\_2.  Vagrantfile\_1 has been left here for backwards compatibility and will be maintained alongside Vagrantfile\_2 until the features are too far past compatibility.

Vagrantfile\_2 && Vagrantfile
------------

These files are compatible with Vagrant 1.1+.  They use all of the vagrant APIs for the new provider framework.  They are compatible with VirtualBox and CentOS 6.  Vagrantfile is a working copy of Vagrantfile_2.  Vagrantfile_2 is a placeholder copy to distinguish the differences between Vagrant < 1.1 & Vagrant 1.1+

> ***Note:*** The version change has made things a little confusing.  Try and default to using the default setup with Vagrant 1.1+  If that is not an option and you can not get things working on your computer, feel free to contact [@gwagner85](https://twitter.com/gwagner85) on twitter.
